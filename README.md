#Discord.js and Puppeteer based self-bot to stream youtube videos in channel.
yeah, its like theatre to have chill with friends xD

Pros:
You do not need to stream from your own pc to make it more laggy (coz it will use data to upload and download discord data)

Cons:
its limited to 2-3 servers, coz you have to give this a dedicated machine to stream discord.js and run puppeteer.
